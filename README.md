Biografía: Gilberto Ochoa Ruiz is a researcher in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Internet of Things. He has participated as associated researcher and lecturer in several programs accredited by the CONACYT PNPC program, geared around Computer Science and Communication and Information Technologies. He is member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI, Rank I) and of the CONACYT Network on Applied Computational Network (RedICA), the Mexican Societies of IA (SMIA) and Computer Sc. (AMEXCOMP), as well as the Latinx in AI (LXAI) Coalition. He as served as reviewer for ICLR, ICML, CVPR and IJCNN and as general chair of the Latinx in Computer Vision Workshops at CVPR and ICCV and as part of the organization or technical program committees of these efforts, as well as other conferences.
Área(s) de investigación: 
•	Artificial Intelligence (Computer vision and machine learning) for medical imaging
•	Applied Computational Intelligence, Smart Connected Devices, AI at the edge
•	Optimization techniques for designing edge AI models and devices.

Research
He is currently involved in the following projects related with medical Imaging and digital pathology, win which we are interested in developing new image medical analysis and processing methods, but also machine learning models to facilitate the diagnosis of various diseases. We are also actively exploring the development of interpretability and explainability tools for deep learning models.
•	    Robust Surgical Tool Segmentation, Tracking and Depth Perception
In collaboration with Dr. Sharib Ali from the Department of Engineering Science, Institute of Biomedical Engineering of the University of Oxford (United Kingdom)

Goal: To develop new datasets, schemes and models for implement robust and real-time computer vision methods for Computer Integrated Surgery (CIS) applications and procedural quality assessment purposes

•	RECONDITE: Assessing the applicability of deep learning and image analysis methods for improving the endoscopic identification of kidney stones composition 
In collaboration with Prof. Christian Daul the Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy, CRAN (France) and the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM)
Goal: To investigate deep learning algorithms for automatically classifying in vivo kidney stones from endoscopy images 
•	PROTEUS: Endoscopic 3D View Enhancement and Automatic Categorization of Gastro-Intestinal Inflammations from Endoscopic data 
In collaboration with Prof. Christian Daul the Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN) and the Hotpital Ambroise-Paré (Paris)
Goal : Real-time 3D organ reconstruction from epithelial surfaces, such as those found in the esophagus, stomach and colon. To explore DL-based SLAM for obtaining fine-grained organ atlas for cancer diagnosis and to combine it with methods for automatically categorizing lesions or pre-cancerous areas from endoscopic procedures
•	ISOLATE: SegmentatIon and claSsification Of vascuLar pATtern symmEtries on cerebral vessels using DL
In collaboration with Dr. Christian Mata and Prof. Enrique Benitez from the Biomedical Engineering Research Center (CREB, Barcelona) of the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (Spain) and the Hospital Sant Joan de Deu (Barcelona)
	    Goal: To develop novel CADx tools for aiding physicians in the diagnosis of CP.
Various algorithms for vessel segmentation and skeletonization have been explored and tested. The results of these preprocessing methods are to be used for classifying vascular pattern asymmetries
Computer Vision and Machine Learning
•	Watch: Wildfire Analysis Through Computer vision tecHniques. 
A collaborative project for early wildfire dentification and ffire widespread forecasting. A collaboration with several Mexican universities and the Universitá di Corsica (France) with Prof. Lucile Rossi from Laboratoire Sciences Pour l’Environnement 

Goal: To investigate novel drone-IoT model for detecting, monitoring and spread forecasting of fires using computer vision

•	    MEANING MEtric And maNIfold learNinG
A collaboration with CINVESTAV Guadalajara with Prof. Andres Mendez-Vazquez group.

Goal: To investigate novel methods for deep metric learning, and related areas such as few-shot learning (FSL), OOD generalization, neural network dissection and explainability.
Additional Information
There are available positions (bachelor, master and PhD) for all these projects via CONACYT and other grants for suitable candidates (contact me for further details). International mobility is strongly encouraged and double diplomas are possible. 
I strongly advice any prospect students to show qualifications in machine deep learning if possible. Showing evidence of previous projects (thesis, articles, GitHub) or qualifications from Coursera (Deep Learning and/or Artificial Intelligence for Medicine) is highly desired.
